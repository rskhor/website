# Hello again, Adobe Illustrator

Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics software, often used to make 2D graphics such as this one. These graphics are in turn exported for various uses in both print mediums and digital interfaces.

I started messing around with Illustrator back in high school. Obviously, I was too cool to be doing anything productive like studying, and eventually ended up doing some freelance graphic design work for remote clients.

Sadly, I lost touch with Adobe Illustrator during university, so I recently committed myself to making simple illustrations on a regular basis in order to familiarise myself with the software again, and finally learn about the advanced features this time round.

# Beyond the software

More importantly, Iâ€™m looking to improve my artistic ability in illustration. It's quite fulfilling to make graphics from scratch, and eventually I hope to develop a personal style. But one major challenge for me right now is using form and colour effectively. I donâ€™t have any formal experience in art or design, so I lack a structured approach or process when it comes to reasoning about such visual elements. This has always been the bottleneck for me, but I'm not sure how exactly I can go about learning about all this theoretical stuff.

Anyway, I also hope to master [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/develop/), which is a free and open source vector graphics software. I'll definitely check out the source code once I learn some C++, and perhaps contribute a couple of pull requests ðŸ™‚
