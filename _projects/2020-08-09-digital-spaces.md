One nice thing about living in Singapore, and perhaps East Asia in general, is the prevalence of pretty tiles and patterns in various physical living spaces. I decided to spend a Sunday afternoon making some basic illustrations based off of real-life tile designs.

I think it's nice to bring some local flavour to our digital interfaces. Why shouldn't digital interfaces give visual hints about where they were made, or what they were influenced by? We don't rob our physical spaces of their cultural context, so why shouldn't digital spaces be just as vibrant?
